    "person. A mobile phone that unlocks using your face is also using face\n",
    "verification. This is a 1:1 matching problem.\n",
    "- **Face Recognition** - \"who is this person?\". For example, the video lecture\n",
    "showed a [face recognition video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr4rx0Spihs)\n",
    "of Baidu employees entering the office without needing to otherwise identify\n",

    "- Put more images of each person (under different lighting conditions, taken on\n",
    "different days, etc.) into the database. Then given a new image, compare the new\n",
    "face to multiple pictures of the person. This would increase accuracy.\n",
    "- Crop the images to just contain the face, and less of the \"border\" region\n",
    "around the face. This preprocessing removes some of the irrelevant pixels around\n",
    "the face, and also makes the algorithm more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key points to remember\n",
    "- Face verification solves an easier 1:1 matching problem; face recognition\n",
    "addresses a harder 1:K matching problem.\n",
    "- The triplet loss is an effective loss function for training a neural network\n",
    "to learn an encoding of a face image.\n",
    "- The same encoding can be used for verification and recognition. Measuring\n",
    "distances between two images' encodings allows you to determine whether they are\n",
    "pictures of the same person.\n",
