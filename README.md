convolutional-neural-networks
=============================

This is another repo containing code I wrote as I was studying Machine
Learning. To complete an on-line course on Convolutional Neural Networks, I had
to finish 6 programming assignments. The corresponding Jupyter notebooks are
listed below:

* [Convolutional Model: Step by Step](x)
* [Convolutional Model: Application](x)
* [Residual Networks](x)
* [Car Detection with YOLO](x)
* [Art Generation with Neural Style Transfer](x)
* [Face Recognition](x)

In a repo like this, whenever it's possible, I include the files storing the
data. I do so for a very simple reason: I want to use this repository as a
means to run my notebooks wherever I wish by just cloning the repo. But in this
case, due to the file size limit imposed by GitHub, it was necessary to leave
out a few large files. Later I'll make them available elsewhere.
