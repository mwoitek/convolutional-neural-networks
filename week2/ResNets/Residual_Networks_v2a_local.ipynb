    "## 1 - The problem of very deep neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, you built your first convolutional neural network. In recent years,\n",
    "neural networks have become deeper, with state-of-the-art networks going from\n",
    "just a few layers (e.g., AlexNet) to over a hundred layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The main benefit of a very deep network is that it can represent very complex\n",
    "functions. It can also learn features at many different levels of abstraction,\n",
    "from edges (at the shallower layers, closer to the input) to very complex\n",
    "features (at the deeper layers, closer to the output).\n",
    "* However, using a deeper network doesn't always help. A huge barrier to\n",
    "training them is vanishing gradients: very deep networks often have a gradient\n",
    "signal that goes to zero quickly, thus making gradient descent prohibitively\n",
    "slow.\n",
    "* More specifically, during gradient descent, as you backprop from the final\n",
    "layer back to the first layer, you are multiplying by the weight matrix on each\n",
    "step, and thus the gradient can decrease exponentially quickly to zero (or, in\n",
    "rare cases, grow exponentially quickly and \"explode\" to take very large values).\n",
    "* During training, you might therefore see the magnitude (or norm) of the\n",

    "(There is also some evidence that the ease of learning an identity function\n",
