    "this dataset.\n",
    "</center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "You've gathered all these images into a folder and have labelled them by drawing\n",

    "In this exercise, you will learn how \"You Only Look Once\" (YOLO) performs object\n",

    "outputs recognized objects together with the bounding boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 - Model details\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inputs and outputs\n",
    "- The **input** is a batch of images, and each image has the shape (m, 608, 608,\n",
    "3)\n",
    "- The **output** is a list of bounding boxes along with the recognized classes.\n",
    "Each bounding box is represented by 6 numbers $(p_c, b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w, c)$ as\n",
    "explained above. If you expand $c$ into an 80-dimensional vector, each bounding\n",
    "box is then represented by 85 numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anchor Boxes\n",
    "* Anchor boxes are chosen by exploring the training data to choose reasonable\n",
    "height/width ratios that represent the different classes.  For this assignment,\n",
    "5 anchor boxes were chosen for you (to cover the 80 classes), and stored in the\n",
    "file './model_data/yolo_anchors.txt'\n",
    "* The dimension for anchor boxes is the second to last dimension in the\n",
    "encoding: $(m, n_H,n_W,anchors,classes)$.\n",
    "* The YOLO architecture is: IMAGE (m, 608, 608, 3) -> DEEP CNN -> ENCODING (m,\n",
    "19, 19, 5, 85).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encoding\n",
    "Let's look in greater detail at what this encoding represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nb_images/architecture.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:400;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> <u> **Figure 2** </u>: **Encoding architecture for YOLO**<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "If the center/midpoint of an object falls into a grid cell, that grid cell is\n",
    "responsible for detecting that object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are using 5 anchor boxes, each of the 19 x19 cells thus encodes\n",
    "information about 5 boxes. Anchor boxes are defined only by their width and\n",
    "height.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will flatten the last two last dimensions of the shape (19,\n",
    "19, 5, 85) encoding. So the output of the Deep CNN is (19, 19, 425).\n",

    "dimensions**<br> </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class score\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, for each box (of each cell) we will compute the following element-wise\n",
    "product and extract a probability that the box contains a certain class.\n",
    "The class score is $score_{c,i} = p_{c} \\times c_{i}$: the probability that\n",
    "there is an object $p_{c}$ times the probability that the object is a certain\n",
    "class $c_{i}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nb_images/probability_extraction.png\" style=\"width:700px;height:400;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> <u> **Figure 4** </u>: **Find the class detected by each\n",
    "box**<br> </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of figure 4\n",
    "* In figure 4, let's say for box 1 (cell 1), the probability that an object\n",
    "exists is $p_{1}=0.60$.  So there's a 60% chance that an object exists in box 1\n",
    "(cell 1).\n",
    "* The probability that the object is the class \"category 3 (a car)\" is\n",
    "$c_{3}=0.73$.\n",
    "* The score for box 1 and for category \"3\" is $score_{1,3}=0.60 \\times 0.73 =\n",
    "0.44$.\n",
    "* Let's say we calculate the score for all 80 classes in box 1, and find that\n",
    "the score for the car class (class 3) is the maximum.  So we'll assign the score\n",
    "0.44 and class \"3\" to this box \"1\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing classes\n",
    "Here's one way to visualize what YOLO is predicting on an image:\n",
    "- For each of the 19x19 grid cells, find the maximum of the probability scores\n",
    "(taking a max across the 80 classes, one maximum for each of the 5 anchor\n",
    "boxes).\n",
    "- Color that grid cell according to what object that grid cell considers the\n",
    "most likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Doing this results in this picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nb_images/proba_map.png\" style=\"width:300px;height:300;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> <u> **Figure 5** </u>: Each one of the 19x19 grid cells is\n",
    "colored according to which class has the largest predicted probability in that\n",
    "cell.<br> </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this visualization isn't a core part of the YOLO algorithm itself for\n",
    "making predictions; it's just a nice way of visualizing an intermediate result\n",
    "of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Visualizing bounding boxes\n",
    "Another way to visualize YOLO's output is to plot the bounding boxes that it\n",
    "outputs. Doing that results in a visualization like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"nb_images/anchor_map.png\" style=\"width:200px;height:200;\">\n",
    "<caption><center> <u> **Figure 6** </u>: Each cell gives you 5 boxes. In total,\n",
    "the model predicts: 19x19x5 = 1805 boxes just by looking once at the image (one\n",
    "forward pass through the network)! Different colors denote different classes.\n",
    "<br> </center></caption>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-Max suppression\n",
    "In the figure above, we plotted only boxes for which the model had assigned a\n",
    "high probability, but this is still too many boxes. You'd like to reduce the\n",
    "algorithm's output to a much smaller number of detected objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do so, you'll use **non-max suppression**. Specifically, you'll carry out\n",
    "these steps:\n",
    "- Get rid of boxes with a low score (meaning, the box is not very confident\n",
    "about detecting a class; either due to the low probability of any object, or low\n",
    "probability of this particular class).\n",
    "- Select only one box when several boxes overlap with each other and detect the\n",
    "same object.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 - Filtering with a threshold on class scores\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to first apply a filter by thresholding. You would like to get rid\n",
    "of any box for which the class \"score\" is less than a chosen threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model gives you a total of 19x19x5x85 numbers, with each box described by 85\n",
    "numbers. It is convenient to rearrange the (19,19,5,85) (or (19,19,425))\n",
    "dimensional tensor into the following variables:\n",
    "- `box_confidence`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 1)$ containing $p_c$\n",
    "(confidence probability that there's some object) for each of the 5 boxes\n",
    "predicted in each of the 19x19 cells.\n",
    "- `boxes`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 4)$ containing the midpoint and\n",
    "dimensions $(b_x, b_y, b_h, b_w)$ for each of the 5 boxes in each cell.\n",
    "- `box_class_probs`: tensor of shape $(19 \\times 19, 5, 80)$ containing the\n",
    "\"class probabilities\" $(c_1, c_2, ... c_{80})$ for each of the 80 classes for\n",
    "each of the 5 boxes per cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Exercise**: Implement `yolo_filter_boxes()`.\n",
    "1. Compute box scores by doing the elementwise product as described in Figure 4\n",
    "($p \\times c$).\n",

    "image, (1,0) is the upper-right corner, and (1,1) is the lower-right corner. In\n",
    "other words, the (0,0) origin starts at the top left corner of the image. As x\n",
    "increases, we move to the right.  As y increases, we move down.\n",
    "- For this exercise, we define a box using its two corners: upper left $(x_1,\n",
    "y_1)$ and lower right $(x_2,y_2)$, instead of using the midpoint, height and\n",
    "width. (This makes it a bit easier to calculate the intersection).\n",
    "- To calculate the area of a rectangle, multiply its height $(y_2 - y_1)$ by its\n",
    "width $(x_2 - x_1)$. (Since $(x_1,y_1)$ is the top left and $x_2,y_2$ are the\n",
    "bottom right, these differences should be non-negative.\n",
    "- To find the **intersection** of the two boxes $(xi_{1}, yi_{1}, xi_{2},\n",
    "yi_{2})$:\n",
    "    - Feel free to draw some examples on paper to clarify this conceptually.\n",
    "    - The top left corner of the intersection $(xi_{1}, yi_{1})$ is found by\n",
    "comparing the top left corners $(x_1, y_1)$ of the two boxes and finding a\n",
    "vertex that has an x-coordinate that is closer to the right, and y-coordinate\n",
    "that is closer to the bottom.\n",
    "    - The bottom right corner of the intersection $(xi_{2}, yi_{2})$ is found by\n",
    "comparing the bottom right corners $(x_2,y_2)$ of the two boxes and finding a\n",
    "vertex whose x-coordinate is closer to the left, and the y-coordinate that is\n",
    "closer to the top.\n",
    "    - The two boxes **may have no intersection**.  You can detect this if the\n",
    "intersection coordinates you calculate end up being the top right and/or bottom\n",
    "left corners of an intersection box.  Another way to think of this is if you\n",
    "calculate the height $(y_2 - y_1)$ or width $(x_2 - x_1)$ and find that at least\n",

    "- YOLO is a state-of-the-art object detection model that is fast and accurate\n",
    "- It runs an input image through a CNN which outputs a 19x19x5x85 dimensional\n",
    "volume.\n",
    "- The encoding can be seen as a grid where each of the 19x19 cells contains\n",
    "information about 5 boxes.\n",
    "- You filter through all the boxes using non-max suppression. Specifically:\n",

    "accurate (high probability) boxes\n",
    "    - Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholding to eliminate overlapping boxes\n",
    "- Because training a YOLO model from randomly initialized weights is non-trivial\n",
    "and requires a large dataset as well as lot of computation, we used previously\n",
